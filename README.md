# Project management

## Spring Training Days day 2


### Workflow
- Work in pairs ('pair programming' style)
  - One driver (shares their screen and performs the actions);
  - One partner (supports the driver, looks up questions, is active and engaged with the driver's work).
- Switch roles at least once:
  - The driver zips the entire project, and emails it to partner *before the break*.
  - The partner unzips all and confirms the project is complete.
- Ask for help when needed
  - Raise your hand in the zoom breakout;
  - A helper will join your breakout room.
