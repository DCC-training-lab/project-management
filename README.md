# Project management

## Spring Training Days day 2

In this Spring Training workshop, we will take you through the life cycle of a project,
teaching good habits along the way, and using familiar tools as much as possible.
We will start at the **PRESENT**, where you will start your project.
From a few data files (adapted from [Hope _et al._, 2021](data/README.md)), you will create an organized project.
Then, we will track the project's history in **PAST**: you will make a changelog,
and create a 'project release' with a version number. Finally, in **FUTURE**,
you will archive and license your project so others can use it.

### Preparation
See how you can prepare for this workshop [here](preparation.md).

### Workflow
- Work in pairs ('pair programming' style)
  - One driver (shares their screen and performs the actions);
  - One partner (supports the driver, looks up questions, is active and engaged with the driver's work).
- Switch roles at least once:
  - The driver zips the entire project, and emails it to partner *before the break*.
  - The partner unzips all and confirms the project is complete.
- Ask for help when needed
  - Raise your hand in the zoom breakout;
  - A helper will join your breakout room.
- Write down questions to discuss with the group
  - At the end of each workshop-element we will reconvene in a plenary session to discuss it.
