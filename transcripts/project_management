Project management



In this video we will introduce some good habits in organization and
documentation of a research project. Organizing and documenting your project
well is not technically difficult to do, especially if you do it from the
beginning. But organization and documentation can make an enormous difference in
making your project easier to work on: for yourself, reducing the chances that
you will make mistakes along the way, and for those who want to understand and
perhaps reuse your project.

1. Save your project in a single folder.

Start with your project in a single folder. Everything that relates to your
project will be inside this folder. This will make your project portable and
cohesive; it will make it easy for someone else to make sense of it. This is a
habit that applies with projects anywhere, but particularly in research projects
it contributes to their reproducibility, which is of course a vital component of
good science. The term 'research compendium' has been coined to refer to a
container for different elements that make up the research presentation: the
paper or report itself, but also the data and the code that is used to analyse
the data and generate the results.

2. Devise a logical system of sub-folders.

Make a logical system of sub folders, looking at what is standard in the
field. There is no one-size-fits-all, but this can be a good structure for a
research project. Having folders separate for data for documentation and four
figures. Make sure you structure your sub folders in a logical way. Don’t be
afraid to make sub sub and sub sub sub folders, so long as it is logical.
Especially when you were working with code or tools that generate content
automatically, it is important to separate the content that is generated
automatically from content that you yourself are writing. It is also important
to separate read-only content from the rest. Raw data should never be meddled
with!

The base of your folder system, the main folder at the highest level of your
project, is called the “root”. This is an important reference point of your
project: it contains the main files that are required to understand the project,
as well as the main sub folders.

3. Introduce the project (or sub-folder) in a README.

Especially on higher levels, it’s recommended that each folder contains a
description, or a README file, that describes the content of that folder. There
are certain things you can put in that README file. A good thing to start with
is always to ask yourself: what if, in one year time, you see this folder again,
what information do you need to understand it fully? With almost everything we
are going to show you, you yourself are the most likely the one to benefit from
a good project structure, and good documentation. Keep this in mind.

Other content you can put in a README is: an explanation of any abbreviations
used, the expected files and folders in your project, and any references that
are necessary.

4. Use interoperable file types.


5. Use descriptive and logical file names.

File names themselves can be important documentation. We are long past the time
that file names need to be short, although there is obviously a limit. A file
name first of all is a description of the file that can never be separated from
that file. While you can move files around and thereby lose information on their
source folder, or documentation such as a README in that folder, a filename is
only altered explicitly. Secondly, file names will be important when you want to
sort your files. Therefore, making sure that file names start with the most
general descriptor of the file content can be relevant. When you are including a
date in your file, and you probably should, start with the year then the month
and then the day. This will make sure that when sorting your files you will sort
them from early to late. It also prevents any confusion with date notation in
different parts of the world. Further advice is to never use spaces in file
names; instead, use dashes, underscores, or CamelCase to separate words.

6. Make your data tidy.
