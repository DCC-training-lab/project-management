## Reminder: workflow

Work in pairs ('pair programming' style):

- the *driver* shares their screen and performs the actions);
- the *partner* supports the driver, looks up questions, is active and engaged
    with the driver's work.

At the end of the exercise:

- the driver zips the entire project, and emails it to partner before the break;
- the partner unzips all and confirms the project is complete.

Ask for help when needed:

- raise your hand in the Zoom breakout;
- a helper will join your breakout room.

Prepare the discussion:

- write down any questions you would like to discuss with the group;
- discuss choices you make during the exercise, and write down your decisions;
- at the end of each workshop-element we will reconvene in a plenary session to
  discuss these.

## Exercise

**Before you start:** Make sure you have [downloaded the
data](https://github.com/escience-academy/2021-06-03-DCC-project-management/raw/main/data/datafiles.zip).
Unzip the files.

*Please note that the information about the data below is fictional, and for
the purposes of the exercise. If you want to learn more about the data used in
these exercises, [click here](data/README.md).*

You are working on a research project on [Wood
ducks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood_duck), and have sent students to the
field to collect data. They have taken your template, and filled out information
about the nests they surveyed. These raw data inputs are your starting point. It
is your job to turn them into a shareable project.

1. Create a single folder in which the entire project will be contained.
1. Devise a project structure. What folders do you need, and how will you
   structure them?
1. Place the data files in one of the folders. Rename them so it is clear what
   they contain.
1. Create one overarching data file that contains all data from the raw files.
   Consider:
    * Is the data in a 'tidy' format, so future processing will be smooth?
    * Do all units match? Is it clear what they are?
    * Is the file format interoperable?
1. Write README files:
    * Start with a README for the project, in the root of the project.
    * Do you think it is necessary to create a README for the data? Why (not)? If
      yes: make one!
