## Reminder: workflow

Work in pairs ('pair programming' style):

- the *driver* shares their screen and performs the actions;
- the *partner* supports the driver, looks up questions, is active and engaged
    with the driver's work.

At the end of the exercise:

- the driver zips the entire project, and emails it to partner before the break;
- the partner unzips all and confirms the project is complete.

Ask for help when needed:

- raise your hand in the Zoom breakout;
- a helper will join your breakout room.

Prepare the discussion:

- write down any questions you would like to discuss with the group;
- discuss choices you make during the exercise, and write down your decisions;
- at the end of each workshop-element we will reconvene in a plenary session to
  discuss these.

## Exercise

**Before you start:** Make sure you have received the complete project folder as
a zipped file from your partner. Unzip the files.
